# Structural Analysis of *KJ Sawka*'s "Cyclonic Steel"

The terminology used here has been filched from [this article on drum n' bass structure](http://home.earthlink.net/~tagutcow/dnbstruct.txt).

The album itself has been [purchased on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Cyclonic-Steel-Kj-Sawka/dp/B001J27G5K) and then analysed using [Propellerheads Reason](https://www.propellerheads.se/en/reason).

## Analysis of Individual Tracks

You may notice that the total track times are slightly different from what the number of measures would suggest.  This is because of the fade-out/silence at the end of the tracks which may exceed or be short of a full measure.  Furthermore, the time measurements are not exact -- I've eyeballed them in the DAW.



### 01. Brotherhood of the Drum


Note that there's about half a measure of silence in the beginning of the track, which is not accounted for in the breakdown below, but is included in the total track time.

measures|count|description
--------|-----|-----------
 01- 24 | 24  | subintro (builds up 4-ish measures at a time, 2 measures of stutter at the end)
 25- 40 | 16  | intro
 41- 56 | 16  | breakdown (4 measure build-up at the end)
 57- 80 | 24  | drop
 81- 96 | 16  | subintro (shortened, 4 measure chill-out at the end)
 97-128 | 32  | intro
129-144 | 16  | breakdown
145-176 | 32  | drop (longer)
177-192 | 16  | drop 2 (smidgeon of melodic stuff added at 185, but otherwise drop drums with some variation)
193-200 |  8  | outro and fade-out (4 each)

Total: **6:32:903** at **124 BPM**


### 02. Cosmos

Most of the meat of this track is in the intro, hence the quotes.  It has a song-like verse-chorus structure.
